# Multica DSH Runtime

Private, out-of-tree runtime bridge between Multica and the public
[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness). It exposes
a versioned JSONL protocol over stdio and composes over
`@deepseek-ai/dsh-base`. It does not require changes to DeepSeek Harness.

## Privacy

- This repository contains only the Multica integration layer. It does not
  vendor or redistribute DeepSeek Harness source code.
- Never commit API keys, MCP secrets, session logs, or generated profiles.
- DSH telemetry is disabled by the bundle patch.
- stdout is protocol-only; diagnostics go to stderr.

## Local development

The DSH packages used by this plugin are public npm packages. This checkout is
currently validated against `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.0-rc.6` and its matching
`@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` package family.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm check
pnpm build
```

Install the local bundle into a DSH profile after building it:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile multica add /absolute/path/to/multica-dsh-runtime
```

The plugin supports:

```bash
dsh --profile multica --probe
dsh --profile multica --list-models
dsh --profile multica --stdio
```

Multica discovers the profile only after `--probe` returns protocol version 1.
For a non-standard DSH installation, point the daemon at its launcher:

```bash
export MULTICA_DSH_PATH=/absolute/path/to/dsh
```

The runtime contract includes:

- model and thinking-level discovery from DSH itself;
- committed text, reasoning, tool, result, and token-usage events;
- cooperative cancellation and durable session resume;
- canonical Multica MCP configuration translated to DSH stdio or
  streamable-HTTP clients;
- per-runtime/agent session roots supplied by the Multica daemon;
- headless one-shot approvals, with no interactive question surface.
- narrowly forwards only Multica's server-minted `mat_` task token into DSH's
  otherwise credential-scrubbed shell, so in-task `multica` commands retain
  task attribution without exposing model-provider credentials.
- optionally forwards `MULTICA_ISSUE_ID` from `ExecuteCommand.issue_id`, so the
  task can write local progress and acceptance state back to its Multica issue;
  see `docs/task-local-writeback.md`.

The local `.local/` tree is ignored. It may hold an isolated DSH home and a
development launcher, but neither belongs in source control.

`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is read by DSH's credential provider at process runtime. It
must not be stored in this repository.
